More advanced users may want to migrate to the [JOSM editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM) at some point for improved editing efficiency or specialized needs.

# JOSM Training resources

### learnOSM.org has many [JOSM detailed editing](http://learnosm.org/en/josm/) resources in many languages.

### Mapbox launched [Mapping with OpenStreetMap](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/) Mapping guides. The guides offer comprehensive training with JOSM including how to become a power mapper and validating OpenStreetMap.

### We also found this [JOSM Basic Manual pdf](https://ma.ellak.gr/documents/2014/09/%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-josm.pdf) on the web, it would be good for a print out.

## Additional JOSM tips:

#### Activate Remote Control. Make sure Remote Control is turned on (this allows the HOT Task Manager to send data directly to your JOSM session): go to Edit⇨Preferences; on the left click on the Remote Control icon (third from bottom), put a check in the box “Enable remote control”, click OK.
