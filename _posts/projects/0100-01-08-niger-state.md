Needs for MSF teams include emergency response to disease outbreaks across the area. Accurate maps of the area will assist emergency teams with epidemiological analysis, disease surveillance and logistical planning.

The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
