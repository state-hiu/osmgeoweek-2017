These jobs are part of USAID/OFDA and USGS/VDAP’s continued efforts in DRR mapping of volcanic hazards in Colombia. Volunteers will create and improve existing infrastructure data, with a focus on tracing buildings, roads, bridges, and inland water features.

Galeras is an active Andean stratovolcano that is located in the Narino department, near Pasto. Galeras is the most active volcano in Colombia and is known for regular eruptions, the most recent occurring in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2010.

Nevado del Ruiz is an active stratovolcano that is located between the Caldas and Tolima departments. Since becoming active, Nevado del Ruiz has had three major eruptions. These eruptions are known for their pyroclastic flows and massive lahars. The last major eruption occurred in 1985, killing 23,000 Colombians and destroying several towns.
