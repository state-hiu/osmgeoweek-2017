This Wednesday we're putting on a fantastic event, in aid of the Missing maps project.
The Missing Maps Project is a global initiative between MSF, British Red Cross, 
American Red Cross and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. The aim of the project is simple; 
create digital maps for all the vulnerable areas of the world.

At Mapathons we create these maps! Using a super simple online software you 'draw' over satellite imagery of an area; 
marking any buildings, roads etc. Your work gets turned into real digital maps for anyone to use, for free!
It's in the University Library, feel free to come for as little and as long as you want!! Starting at 17:30!!!! In uol103
Can't wait to see you all!!!!
