Remember our great plan to import nearly 100k buildings in Miami-Dade County to OpenStreetMap? 
It's coming together so all Maptime Miami needs is YOU!

Since it's #osmgeoweek, we'd like to invite you for a Mapathon where we could gather and start mapping together. 
Whether you're a novice mapper or a professional, you can join the fun and help putting several buildings on the map - 
so they will be available for everyone! Beginners welcome!

This is a "bring your own laptop" event. We'll have a short presentation explaining the concepts of this building 
import as well as illustrating all the steps that you need to become a mapper. We will show you the nice resources 
that we have put together in order to get you started in the OSM universe. We will have plenty of time for your 
questions and for teaching you how to map.
