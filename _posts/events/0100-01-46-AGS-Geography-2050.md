Join the American Geographical Society for a ‘Mapathon’, an OpenStreetMap (OSM) training event. 
As part of the Geography 2050 conference, you’ll learn how to contribute to the map, 
focusing on marginally mapped communities across the United States. Given the theme of the 2016 AGS Fall Symposium, 
Envisioning a Sustainable Planet, gateway communities around U.S. National Parks have been selected as the target areas. 
Please bring your laptop, mouse and your open mapping curiosity to join the mapping!
